# Intelligent Performance Enhancement Platform (IPEP)

IPEP is a machine learning-based platform designed to enhance athletic performance through personalized training and injury prediction.

## Overview

The Intelligent Performance Enhancement Platform (IPEP) is a machine learning-based system designed to assist athletes and their coaches by delivering personalized training programs and predicting injury risks. This platform leverages machine learning algorithms to process athlete data and provide relevant insights to improve athletic performance.

### Core Components

1. **Data Handling**
   - Utilizes CSV files to store athlete data.
   - Provides utility functions for data loading and preprocessing, such as filling missing values and handling categorical data.

2. **Model Training**
   - Implements a machine learning model using a Random Forest Classifier to predict injury risks.
   - Uses \`scikit-learn\` for splitting data into training and testing sets, training the model, and evaluating its accuracy.

3. **Injury Risk Prediction**
   - Applies the trained model to new athlete data to predict potential injury risks.
   - Facilitates new data input and generates injury risk predictions for athletes.

4. **Personalized Training Plans**
   - Framework for creating personalized training regimens based on athlete characteristics, such as agility.
   - Plans can be adapted with machine learning or predefined rules.

### Setup and Installation

To set up the IPEP environment, ensure you have Python installed and follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required Python libraries listed in the \`requirements.txt\` file using pip:
   \`\`\`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

### Usage

The platform consists of several Python scripts that you can run:

1. **Train the Model**
   - Execute the training script to build the model for injury prediction.
   \`\`\`
   python src/train_model.py
   \`\`\`

2. **Predict Injury Risk**
   - Use the prediction script to assess injury risks for new athlete data.
   \`\`\`
   python src/predict_injury.py
   \`\`\`

3. **Create Personalized Training Plan**
   - Generate personalized training regimens based on athlete characteristics.
   \`\`\`
   python src/personalize_training.py
   \`\`\`

### Notes

This implementation provides a foundation for developing more advanced features and expanding the system's capabilities. The model and logic can be enhanced with additional data and further tuning to improve accuracy and reliability. This README serves as a guide to understanding and using the current implementation effectively.
